WORK EXPERIENCE	
---------------
CORVALLIS KNIGHTS BASEBALL (West Coast League - Collegiate Wood Bat)	Corvallis, OR

Baseball Analyst Intern	Jun 2022 – Aug 2022

Automated post game reports to be emailed after the final out using Trackman, Python (openpyxl, matplotlib, pandas) and SQL, creating a direct feedback loop for players and coaches.

Formulated Compete+, an advanced statistic based on Trackman and boxscore data that ranks hundreds of pitchers against league average on their ability to throw strikes in high-pressure situations (ie. runners in scoring position, tying run at the plate/on base in 7th or later, hitter leverage counts, etc.)

Created monthly hitter chase reports utilizing Trackman, Python and SQL to analyze individual hitters’ O-Swing% broken down by pitch-type and count

Provided weekly quality at-bat charts to coaches broken down by LHP/RHP to assist in lineup creation and pinch-hit decisions

Utilized Synergy Video Editor to create pitcher scouting videos, broken down by pitch type and 2k count, that were displayed on loop in the clubhouse prior to the first pitch of every home game (during this process I found opportunities to pick pitchers and catchers and would relay any tells to our coaching staff)

Assisted with reading Synergy spray charts for the creation of our defensive shift cards as well as assisted with creating run game cards from Synergy video (pitcher break times, catcher pop times, pick-off move ratings, etc.)
